When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	to work with other people?

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	If there are some changes on my local repository, it might need to merge the local version and the github one.

	git push [remote_name] [local_branch_name]
	ex) git push origin master
	pull origin master
	git remote
	git remote -v

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

    forks: clone occurred only in github
