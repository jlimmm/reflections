When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	to work with other people?

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	If there are some changes on my local repository, it might need to merge the local version and the github one.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

    forks: clone occurred only in github

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?



=== cheatsheet

	git push [remote_name] [local_branch_name]
	ex) git push origin master
	git pull origin master
	git remote
	git remote -v
	git branch -a
	git fetch origin
